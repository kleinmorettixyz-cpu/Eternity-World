# 1. WORLD IDENTITY & ONTOLOGY

## 1.1 World Name

**Primary Name:** Eternity World  
**Alternative Names:**
- Dunia Abadi (religious register)
- The World That Remembers (archival texts)
- E-Terra (pre-collapse documents)

The name “Eternity” does not imply immortality.
It reflects **persistence of consequence**, not endless life.

---

## 1.2 World Type

**Classification:**  
Closed-System Reality with Partial Internal Variance

**Definition:**
- No unrestricted external intervention
- No absolute reset
- No isolated miracles

All phenomena are bound by internal rules.

---

## 1.3 Ontological Status

Eternity World is **not sentient**,  
but it is **not inert**.

It possesses:
- systemic memory
- environmental inertia
- consequence accumulation

The world does not judge.
The world records.

---

## 1.4 Core Existential Principle

> **Nothing disappears completely.**

Events leave:
- biological residue
- psychological echoes
- metaphysical distortion
- historical misinformation

This principle overrides morality, intent, and scale.

---

# 2. LAWS OF REALITY

## 2.1 Law of Absolute Cost

There is no power without cost.

Cost may manifest as:
- physical degradation
- neural erosion
- memory instability
- environmental decay
- identity fracture

Cost can be delayed.
Cost cannot be nullified.

---

## 2.2 Law of Non-Reversal

Time is unidirectional.

- No rewind
- No resurrection without loss
- No clean erasure

Attempts to violate this law result in:
- local reality collapse
- unstable anomalies
- permanent scar zones

---

## 2.3 Law of Partial Knowledge

No entity possesses total understanding.

This includes:
- gods
- ancient systems
- world-scale mechanisms

Truth exists,
but access is fragmented.

Conflict emerges from asymmetrical knowledge.

---

## 2.4 Law of Accumulative Saturation

Repeated stress on any system leads to degradation.

Applies to:
- magic usage
- ecosystems
- societies
- individuals
- civilizations

Stability is temporary.
Collapse is gradual.

---

# 3. WORLD CONSCIOUSNESS & SYSTEMIC MEMORY

## 3.1 Definition

Eternity World possesses **Systemic Memory**, not will.

It does not act.
It reacts through altered conditions.

---

## 3.2 Memory Storage Mechanisms

The world records:
- extreme emotional concentration
- mass death
- repeated ritual patterns
- prolonged distortion of laws

Storage medium includes:
- terrain
- mana density
- biological mutation
- collective dreams

---

## 3.3 Scar Zones

Scar Zones are locations where recovery failed.

Common properties:
- unstable magic behavior
- abnormal flora/fauna
- recurring hallucinations
- emotional resonance amplification

Scar Zones are not evil.
They are exhausted.

---

## 3.4 World Fatigue Hypothesis (Unconfirmed)

Ancient records suggest:
- the world has a saturation threshold
- excessive manipulation accelerates decay

This theory is suppressed in official doctrine.

---

# 4. TEMPORAL STRUCTURE & TIME LOGIC

## 4.1 Time Flow

Time progresses linearly.

Local distortions:
- possible
- temporary
- catastrophic if sustained

---

## 4.2 Event Weighting

The world remembers by **impact**, not chronology.

Minor events vanish.
Major trauma persists for eras.

This causes:
- historical gaps
- mythologized catastrophes
- misplaced cultural fear

---

## 4.3 Temporal Anchors

Certain events become temporal anchors:
- wars of extinction
- civilization collapse
- failed world-scale rituals

Anchors influence future probability distributions.

---

> Next: **Section 5 — Geography (Macro Structure)**


# 5. GEOGRAPHY (MACRO STRUCTURE)

## 5.1 Planetary Overview

Eternity World follows a terrestrial model with deviations caused by
long-term magical saturation and historical catastrophe.

**Core Properties:**
- Single primary landmass dominance (fragmented supercontinents)
- Uneven mana distribution
- Climatic anomalies tied to historical events

Geography in Eternity World is not neutral.
Land remembers usage.

---

## 5.2 Continental Division

The world is divided into **five recognized macro-continents**.
Each continent functions as a semi-closed ecological and cultural system.

### 5.2.1 Aetherion (Central Continent)

**Status:** Primary population hub  
**Mana Density:** Medium–High (stable)  
**Narrative Role:** Political and cultural reference point

Aetherion hosts:
- the highest concentration of recorded history
- the most “normalized” magic usage
- the largest accumulation of rewritten history

It is considered the “civilized world” by its own standards.

---

### 5.2.2 Noctyra (Northern Shadow Continent)

**Status:** Semi-abandoned  
**Mana Density:** High but unstable  
**Environmental Traits:**
- prolonged twilight zones
- low solar penetration
- frequent Scar Zones

Noctyra is avoided not because it is hostile,
but because it is **unforgiving**.

Civilizations here tend to:
- collapse fast
- mutate biologically
- develop extreme cultural adaptations

---

### 5.2.3 Solmire Expanse (Southern Arid Continent)

**Status:** Harsh survival zone  
**Mana Density:** Low, localized spikes  
**Dominant Features:**
- mana-dead deserts
- subterranean civilizations
- ancient sealed structures

Magic in Solmire is treated as a resource,
not a birthright.

---

### 5.2.4 Verdantia Shards (Western Fragmented Lands)

**Status:** Ecologically volatile  
**Mana Density:** High, fluctuating  
**Geographic Form:** Broken archipelagos

Verdantia is alive in ways other continents are not.

- flora reacts to emotion
- fauna shows adaptive intelligence
- terrain shifts subtly over decades

Scholars debate whether Verdantia is entering
a proto-sentient ecological phase.

---

### 5.2.5 Ashkara Deep (Eastern Submerged Continent)

**Status:** Mostly underwater  
**Mana Density:** Extremely high (deep layers)  
**Accessibility:** Limited

Ashkara is known primarily through:
- relic recovery
- fragmented survivor myths
- abnormal ocean currents

Its collapse predates most written records.

---

## 5.3 Mana Geography

Mana does not distribute evenly.

### 5.3.1 Mana Veins

Subsurface concentrations that:
- fuel civilizations
- attract conflict
- destabilize overuse

Cities built on veins flourish,
then decay.

---

### 5.3.2 Dead Zones

Areas where mana circulation collapsed.

Properties:
- magic failure guaranteed
- biological fatigue
- psychological dulling

Dead Zones are feared by mages
and valued by those escaping magic.

---

## 5.4 Climate Logic

Climate is influenced by:
- latitude
- altitude
- mana saturation
- historical scars

### 5.4.1 Scar-Driven Weather

Examples:
- permanent storms over ancient battlefields
- heat distortion near failed rituals
- unnatural snowfall zones

Weather patterns often contradict
planetary norms.

---

## 5.5 Trade Routes & Natural Barriers

Geography dictates economy.

### 5.5.1 Natural Chokepoints

- mountain passes stabilized by mana
- narrow sea corridors with hostile currents
- desert paths aligned with mana-safe windows

Control of these points equals power.

---

### 5.5.2 Isolation Zones

Some regions remain isolated due to:
- terrain hostility
- mana interference
- cultural taboo

Isolation is not accidental.
It is often enforced.

---

## 5.6 Geographic Influence on Culture

Culture adapts to land, not ideology.

Examples:
- Aetherion cities value regulation and control
- Noctyra tribes normalize loss and mutation
- Solmire societies prioritize conservation over expansion

Geography produces mentality.

---

## 5.7 Cartographic Reliability

No world map is fully accurate.

Reasons:
- shifting land due to saturation
- censored regions
- politically altered cartography

Maps are ideological documents.

---

## 5.8 Foreshadowing (Geographic Scale)

- Mana veins show signs of depletion
- Scar Zones are expanding slowly
- Verdantia’s ecological behavior is accelerating

The land itself is approaching a threshold.

---

> END OF PART 2  
> Next: **PART 3 — Races & Biological Rules**


# 6. RACES & BIOLOGICAL RULES

## 6.1 Core Biological Doctrine

In Eternity World, race is not cosmetic.
It is a **biological system with trade-offs**.

Every race:
- is born
- ages
- degrades
- adapts
- carries evolutionary debt

There are no perfect lineages.
Only survivable ones.

---

## 6.2 Universal Biological Constraints

All sapient races share these limits:

- Cellular fatigue over time
- Neural overload under sustained mana exposure
- Reproductive cost tied to mana affinity
- Irreversible damage accumulation

Immortality does not exist.
Longevity only delays decay.

---

## 6.3 Mana–Biology Interaction Model

Mana is not external fuel.
It **passes through biology**.

### 6.3.1 Mana Conduction Types

Races are classified by how mana interacts with their bodies:

1. **Neural Conduction**
   - mana flows via nervous system
   - high precision
   - high risk of cognitive erosion

2. **Circulatory Conduction**
   - mana binds to blood chemistry
   - stable output
   - gradual organ damage

3. **Structural Conduction**
   - mana embedded in bone / tissue
   - low flexibility
   - high physical mutation risk

Each race defaults to one,
but variation exists.

---

## 6.4 Primary Sapient Races (Global)

### 6.4.1 Humans (Baseline Adaptive Species)

**Origin:** Aetherion  
**Mana Affinity:** Medium  
**Conduction Type:** Neural–Circulatory Hybrid  
**Average Lifespan:** 70–90 years

Humans are not weak.
They are **unfinished**.

Traits:
- rapid learning curve
- high behavioral adaptability
- unstable specialization

Weaknesses:
- mana exhaustion
- psychological overload
- high variance outcomes

Human dominance stems from:
- population elasticity
- cultural replication
- tolerance for failure

---

### 6.4.2 Etherborn (High Saturation Descendants)

**Origin:** Verdantia Shards  
**Mana Affinity:** Very High  
**Conduction Type:** Structural  
**Average Lifespan:** 120–160 years

Etherborn evolved in mana-dense ecology.

Traits:
- innate spell resonance
- altered skeletal structures
- low mana leakage

Costs:
- infertility risk
- irreversible mutation drift
- emotional flattening over time

Etherborn cultures fear stagnation
more than death.

---

### 6.4.3 Umbrals (Noctyra Shadow Lineages)

**Origin:** Noctyra  
**Mana Affinity:** High (unstable)  
**Conduction Type:** Neural  
**Average Lifespan:** 90–110 years

Adapted to low-light, high-stress environments.

Traits:
- heightened perception
- rapid reflex adaptation
- resistance to fear stimuli

Costs:
- chronic insomnia
- memory fragmentation
- increased hallucination under mana stress

Umbrals normalize psychological damage
as a survival trait.

---

### 6.4.4 Solmiri (Arid-Born Survivors)

**Origin:** Solmire Expanse  
**Mana Affinity:** Low  
**Conduction Type:** Circulatory  
**Average Lifespan:** 60–80 years

Magic-poor but biologically efficient.

Traits:
- dehydration resistance
- metabolic efficiency
- delayed fatigue response

Costs:
- poor magic recovery
- organ calcification in later life

Solmiri cultures treat magic
as an expendable tool.

---

### 6.4.5 Pelagic Descendants (Ashkara Lineage)

**Origin:** Ashkara Deep  
**Mana Affinity:** Extreme (depth-dependent)  
**Conduction Type:** Structural–Circulatory  
**Average Lifespan:** Unknown (records fragmented)

Adapted to pressure and mana density.

Traits:
- pressure-resistant physiology
- bio-luminescent organ clusters
- partial aquatic respiration

Costs:
- surface instability
- mana toxicity outside native depth

Their near-extinction defines
much of Ashkara mythology.

---

## 6.5 Reproduction & Lineage Drift

Reproduction is affected by:
- mana saturation
- partner compatibility
- environmental stability

### 6.5.1 Lineage Drift

Over generations:
- traits amplify
- defects accumulate
- hybrid instability rises

Pureblood myths persist,
but are biologically false.

---

## 6.6 Disease, Mutation, and Decay

### 6.6.1 Mana Sickness

Symptoms:
- tremors
- emotional blunting
- memory holes

Irreversible past a threshold.

---

### 6.6.2 Adaptive Mutation

Occurs when:
- exposure is prolonged
- survival pressure is extreme

Mutation is not evolution.
It is emergency repair.

---

## 6.7 Social Stratification by Biology

Racial traits are politicized.

Examples:
- Etherborn valued as assets
- Umbrals feared as unstable
- Solmiri underestimated
- Pelagic Descendants mythologized

Biology becomes hierarchy.

---

## 6.8 Cross-Race Compatibility

Hybrid births are possible,
but outcomes are unpredictable.

Common results:
- mana conduction conflict
- shortened lifespan
- unique abilities with severe cost

Hybrids are rare
and heavily scrutinized.

---

## 6.9 Foreshadowing (Biological Scale)

- Mutation rates increasing globally
- Fertility declining in high-mana regions
- Adaptive traits becoming maladaptive

The world is pushing bodies
beyond sustainable limits.

---

> END OF PART 3  
> Next: **PART 4 — Magic System (Core)**

# 7. MAGIC SYSTEM — CORE FRAMEWORK

## 7.1 Foundational Principle

Magic is **not a miracle**.  
Magic is **a natural process with cost**.

Mana obeys laws.
Violation of laws does not grant power —
it produces damage.

There is no spell without consequence.

---

## 7.2 Ontological Definition of Mana

Mana is a **field phenomenon**, not energy.

Characteristics:
- Non-sentient
- Non-aligned
- Pressure-reactive
- Biologically invasive

Mana exists everywhere,
but only **condenses** under specific conditions.

---

## 7.3 Mana States

Mana exists in three functional states:

### 7.3.1 Ambient Mana
- free-floating
- low density
- passive influence on ecology

### 7.3.2 Bound Mana
- attached to matter or organisms
- stored in biological or structural media
- unstable when displaced

### 7.3.3 Active Mana
- intentionally shaped
- transient
- destructive to the host body

All magic uses **Active Mana**.

---

## 7.4 Mana Density Gradient

The world is divided by mana pressure.

| Zone | Density | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| Low | Scarce | Magic inefficient |
| Medium | Stable | Sustainable casting |
| High | Volatile | Mutation risk |
| Extreme | Lethal | Biological collapse |

Civilizations do not choose locations by beauty,
but by **mana survivability**.

---

## 7.5 Spellcasting Is Not Creation

Spellcasting is **mana reconfiguration**.

A caster does not:
- create fire
- summon light
- bend reality

They **force mana into a configuration**
that reality tolerates *temporarily*.

Reality always reasserts itself.

---

## 7.6 Casting Pipeline (Mandatory)

Every spell follows the same pipeline:

1. **Perception**
   - sensing ambient mana
2. **Extraction**
   - pulling mana into the body
3. **Stabilization**
   - preventing biological rejection
4. **Structuring**
   - imposing form and behavior
5. **Release**
   - externalization
6. **Recoil**
   - systemic backlash

Skipping a step causes failure or injury.

---

## 7.7 Cognitive Load & Mental Cost

Mana processing taxes cognition.

Symptoms scale with intensity:
- migraines
- dissociation
- memory erosion
- personality drift

Long-term casters experience
identity fragmentation.

Magic reshapes the mind
before it reshapes the world.

---

## 7.8 Schools of Magic (Functional, Not Elemental)

Magic is classified by **operation**, not element.

### 7.8.1 Transmutation
Alters material properties.

Cost:
- cellular instability
- entropy debt

---

### 7.8.2 Projection
External force application.

Cost:
- nerve damage
- muscle micro-tears

---

### 7.8.3 Manipulation
Control over existing systems.

Cost:
- sensory overload
- delayed neural decay

---

### 7.8.4 Binding
Anchoring mana to targets.

Cost:
- mana leakage
- long-term organ damage

---

### 7.8.5 Perception
Enhancing or altering awareness.

Cost:
- hallucinations
- loss of baseline perception

---

## 7.9 Elements Are Cultural Constructs

Fire, water, shadow, light, etc.
are **interpretive metaphors**.

They exist because:
- minds require visualization
- tradition simplifies teaching

Mana itself is non-elemental.

Elemental specialization
limits adaptability.

---

## 7.10 Mana Capacity & Saturation

Each body has:
- **Capacity** (how much mana tolerated)
- **Throughput** (how fast mana flows)
- **Recovery Rate**

Exceeding any limit causes:
- acute collapse
- permanent damage
- death

Training expands limits
but never removes them.

---

## 7.11 Artifacts & External Foci

Artifacts do not grant magic.
They **shift burden**.

Functions:
- stabilize structuring
- reduce cognitive load
- redistribute recoil

Hidden cost:
- dependency
- catastrophic failure on overload

---

## 7.12 Anti-Magic Is Not Absence

Anti-magic zones:
- disrupt mana coherence
- increase casting cost
- destabilize active spells

They are **hostile environments**,
not safe havens.

---

## 7.13 Failure States

Spell failure outcomes include:
- partial manifestation
- uncontrolled release
- internal detonation
- neural burnout

Failure is expected.
Survival is skill.

---

## 7.14 Long-Term Consequences

Chronic casting leads to:
- reduced fertility
- emotional numbing
- shortened lifespan

High-tier mages
rarely die peacefully.

---

## 7.15 Myth vs Reality

Myths exist because:
- survivors write history
- corpses remain silent

Legends omit:
- failed attempts
- deformed bodies
- erased minds

Magic culture is survivor bias.

---

## 7.16 Foreshadowing (Magical Scale)

- Mana density rising globally
- Artifact reliance increasing
- Natural recovery rates declining

Magic is becoming
unsustainable at scale.

---

> END OF PART 4  
> Next: **PART 5 — Nations & Power Structures**


# 8. NATIONS & POWER STRUCTURES

## 8.1 Foundational Truth

Power in Eternity World is **layered**, not centralized.

No single entity controls:
- magic
- land
- history
- narrative

Authority exists through **overlap**, not dominance.

---

## 8.2 Types of Power

All power structures fall into five categories.
Every nation uses a different mix.

### 8.2.1 Territorial Power
Control of land, borders, population.

Strength:
- taxation
- military draft
- infrastructure

Weakness:
- inflexible
- slow response
- dependent on legitimacy

---

### 8.2.2 Magical Power
Control of mana access and education.

Strength:
- asymmetric dominance
- deterrence
- elite leverage

Weakness:
- biological cost
- scarcity of talent
- internal collapse risk

---

### 8.2.3 Economic Power
Control of resources, trade routes, logistics.

Strength:
- indirect influence
- sustainability
- scalability

Weakness:
- vulnerable to disruption
- requires stability

---

### 8.2.4 Informational Power
Control of records, education, maps, myths.

Strength:
- shapes perception
- rewrites causality
- persists across generations

Weakness:
- fragile when exposed
- contested by lived experience

---

### 8.2.5 Existential Power
Ability to erase, seal, or invalidate others.

Strength:
- absolute deterrence
- mythic authority

Weakness:
- unstable
- self-destructive
- attracts annihilation

---

## 8.3 Aetherion Central Concord

**Type:** Bureaucratic Federation  
**Primary Power:** Informational + Territorial

Aetherion governs through:
- standardized law
- controlled education
- regulated magic licensing

It does not suppress magic —
it **monopolizes legitimacy**.

---

### 8.3.1 The Concord Archive

The single most influential institution.

Functions:
- certifies historical truth
- maintains official maps
- licenses magical research

Uncertified knowledge
is treated as dangerous.

---

## 8.4 Noctyra Autonomous Zones

**Type:** Fragmented tribal confederations  
**Primary Power:** Existential + Biological adaptation

Noctyra rejects:
- centralized governance
- permanent settlements
- written law

Authority is earned through survival.

Mutation is normalized,
not stigmatized.

---

## 8.5 Solmire Trade Cities

**Type:** Mercantile city-states  
**Primary Power:** Economic

Magic users are:
- assets
- liabilities
- strictly regulated

Solmire culture treats mana
as a **finite commodity**.

Illegal casting
is punished economically,
not morally.

---

## 8.6 Verdantia Collective Enclaves

**Type:** Decentralized ecological societies  
**Primary Power:** Environmental leverage

Governance is:
- slow
- consensus-driven
- reactive to land signals

Verdantian leaders
consult terrain responses
before political decisions.

---

## 8.7 Ashkara Remnant Powers

**Type:** Myth-adjacent remnants  
**Primary Power:** Existential

Ashkara has no nation-state.
Only:
- sealed zones
- autonomous relic factions
- silent deep structures

Interaction with Ashkara
is considered an act of risk,
not diplomacy.

---

## 8.8 Military Doctrine

Standing armies are inefficient.

Modern conflict relies on:
- rapid deployment units
- mage suppression squads
- infrastructure sabotage

Total war is avoided
due to mana destabilization risk.

---

## 8.9 Power Balance Instability

The current equilibrium exists because:
- mana is becoming volatile
- artifacts are failing
- historical lies are eroding

No structure is stable.

Collapse will not come from invasion,
but from **systemic contradiction**.

---

## 8.10 Internal Contradictions

Every power structure hides its flaw:

- Aetherion relies on censored truth
- Noctyra cannot scale governance
- Solmire commodifies survival
- Verdantia cannot act quickly
- Ashkara cannot re-emerge safely

These contradictions drive narrative conflict.

---

## 8.11 Succession & Legitimacy

Legitimacy is not hereditary.

It is derived from:
- survival
- proof of competence
- narrative control

Bloodlines decay quickly.

---

## 8.12 Foreshadowing (Political Scale)

- Archive credibility fractures emerging
- Trade routes destabilizing
- Existential weapons resurfacing

The world is politically overextended.

---

> END OF PART 5  
> Next: **PART 6 — Religion, Myth, & False Gods**
> # 9. RELIGION, MYTH, & FALSE GODS

## 9.1 Foundational Premise

Religion in Eternity World is **instrumental**, not divine.  
Gods exist as **cultural constructs**, **magical anchors**, or **political tools**, not omnipotent beings.  

All religious systems have three layers:  

1. **Official Doctrine** — public, codified rituals and rules.  
2. **Hidden Truths** — myths, contradictions, manipulations.  
3. **Cultural Memory** — collective perception of morality and history.

---

## 9.2 Major Religious Systems

### 9.2.1 The Shattered Pantheon

- Origin: Pre-cataclysmic continent Ashkara  
- Nature: Fragmented, local deities turned **political symbols**  
- Key Features:  
  - Each city-state worships one aspect  
  - Artifacts often mistaken for divine weapons  
  - Priests often act as **mana regulators**  
- Narrative Function:  
  - Foreshadows Ashkara resurgence  
  - Conflicts arise from false divine mandates

---

### 9.2.2 Luminarch Order

- Origin: Aetherion Central Concord  
- Nature: Monotheistic-leaning bureaucracy  
- Doctrine: "Truth is sacred, knowledge divine"  
- Practices:  
  - Ceremonial observation of natural events  
  - Mana licensing framed as holy rite  
- Power Role: Religious doctrine = **soft power**, legitimizes archive authority  
- Hidden Truth: The “divine light” is **mana purification tech**, misinterpreted as divine favor

---

### 9.2.3 Noctyra Spiritway

- Nature: Animist, survival-based  
- Spirits = localized phenomena, some man-made  
- Practices: Hunting rites, terrain offerings, “blood pacts”  
- Narrative Use:  
  - Moral ambiguity — killing may invoke spirits  
  - Tests character adaptability and perception  
- Hidden Truth: Spirits are **biological/psionic reactions** amplified by mana

---

### 9.2.4 Verdantia Green Covenant

- Religion = ecological philosophy  
- Gods = symbolic representations of terrain responses  
- Rituals: Seasonal, terrain-consultative  
- Function: Guides political decisions in decentralized enclaves  
- Hidden Truth: Belief in “forest gods” stabilizes consensus; removes chance of unilateral mistakes

---

### 9.2.5 Solmire Merchant Saints

- Saints = historical traders mythologized  
- Worship = loyalty, civic duty, financial prudence  
- Narrative Function: Drives trade-based morality, punishes hubris indirectly

---

## 9.3 False Gods & Manufactured Divinity

- False gods exist as **mana artifacts**, **political symbols**, or **mythic propaganda**  
- Example:  
  - Ashkara Seal Lords — perceived immortals, actually artifact-bound mortals  
  - Concord “Light of Proof” — ritualized tech interpreted as miracle

- Mechanics:  
  - Mana surge + social faith → perceived miracles  
  - Vulnerable to exposure → narrative tension

---

## 9.4 Mythic History vs. Recorded History

- Historical falsification common:  
  - Wars erased  
  - Artifacts misattributed  
  - “Gods” invented posthumously to justify regimes

- Role in storytelling:  
  - Foreshadows plot twist  
  - Misaligned memory of characters vs. world

---

## 9.5 Ritual Mechanics

- Rituals manipulate mana, not invoke divine will  
- Outcome depends on:  
  - Collective belief  
  - Mana supply & resonance  
  - Environmental factors  
- Ritual success/failure is **consistent and rule-based**, never arbitrary

---

## 9.6 Religious Conflicts

- Source of tension: overlapping claims + mana scarcity  
- Examples:  
  - Luminarch vs Verdantia — doctrine vs ecology  
  - Noctyra vs Solmire — survival vs commerce  
- Narrative Role:  
  - Non-combat conflict  
  - Character testing — moral, strategic, emotional

---

## 9.7 Foreshadowing & Systemic Memory

- Ancient relics = basis for divine myths  
- Past catastrophes = seed for false canon  
- Collective memory misleads both characters and readers  

> **Narrative Principle:** Gods are **storytelling tools**, not ultimate arbiters.

---

> END OF PART 6  
> Next: **PART 7 — Magic, Mana Systems, & Rule-Based Sorcery**

# 10. MAGIC, MANA SYSTEMS, & RULE-BASED SORCERY

## 10.1 Foundational Principles

Magic in Eternity World is **structured, measurable, and fallible**.  
Sihir **tidak instan**, **tidak omnipotent**, dan selalu membawa **risiko jangka panjang**.  

### Core Tenets:

1. **Mana as Resource** — Semua sihir membutuhkan **mana internal dan eksternal**.  
2. **Activation Requires Skill** — Pengetahuan + fokus + ritual = efek.  
3. **Price of Power** — Salah satu: fisik, mental, sosial, atau spiritual.  
4. **Consistency is Mandatory** — Hukum sihir tetap berlaku, dunia tidak membiarkan cheat.

---

## 10.2 Mana Sources

| Source | Description | Accessibility | Risk |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|
| Internal Mana | Bawaan tubuh, terikat pada energi hidup | Semua manusia/ras | Overexertion → luka permanen, burn out |
| Environmental Mana | Ley lines, mana nodes, special terrain | Terbatas, lokasi spesifik | Overload → lokasi rusak, mental terganggu |
| Artifact Mana | Disimpan di benda, dijaga oleh konstruksi | Eksklusif | Penggunaan jangka panjang → artefak rusak, efek samping |
| Ritual Channels | Kolektif atau ceremonial mana | Membutuhkan peserta + lokasi | Kesalahan → backlash masal, fatal |

> **Catatan:** Mana bersifat kuantitatif dan bisa diuji. Tidak ada “limitless energy”.

---

## 10.3 Spell Taxonomy

### 10.3.1 Tiers

| Tier | Effect Scale | Cost | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| Tier 1 | Minor effects, individual | Low | Minimal, fatigue |
| Tier 2 | Tactical effects, small group | Medium | Injuries, mental strain |
| Tier 3 | Regional effects | High | Permanent damage, environmental impact |
| Tier 4 | Global / catastrophic | Extreme | Potential death, reality distortion |

---

### 10.3.2 Schools of Magic

1. **Elemental Manipulation**  
   - Fire, Water, Air, Earth  
   - Rules: Elemental equilibrium, backlash if misaligned  
   - Tier 4 = volcanic eruption, not instant beam

2. **Psychic/Illusionary Arts**  
   - Mental manipulation, perception change  
   - Cost: Mental fatigue, memory loss  
   - Risk: Self-delusion, insanity

3. **Healing & Transmutation**  
   - Restore, alter matter

> Dilema ini menambah layer psikologis, internal conflict, dan twist moral.

---

| **Environmental Influence** | Mana dipengaruhi medan & lokasi | Contoh: ley lines, sacred sites, cursed grounds |

> Semua karakter memiliki batasan yang jelas; **tidak ada power-up instant**.

---

## 17.3 Spellcasting Mechanics

1. **Incantation / Gestures** → mengarahkan energi, minimal 1 detik  
2. **Focus / Concentration** → kesalahan fatal jika terganggu  
3. **Material Components** → optional untuk kekuatan tambahan  
4. **Catalysts / Artefacts** → meningkatkan output, tapi risiko overload

> Artefacts adalah **ekonomi, plot device, dan karakter growth tools**.

---

## 17.6 Magical Economy

- Mana-sensitive materials → bernilai tinggi  
- Spell components → trade & scarcity → konflik politik  
- Artefacts → sumber kekuasaan & persaingan antar guild / negara

> Konsep ekonomi membuat dunia terasa realistis & interaktif.

---

## 17.7 Magical Education & Guilds

- **Formal Academies**: structured, progressive, risk-aware  
- **Apprenticeships**: practical, high-risk, mentor-dependent  
- **Secret Orders**: experimental magic, high stakes, black-market learning  

> Pendidikan membatasi siapa bisa mengakses spell tinggi.  
> Karakter seperti Iam akan **mengamati & mempelajari** sebelum berani eksekusi.

---

## 17.8 Magical Conflict & Politics

- Mana scarcity → war, trade disputes  
- Guild rivalries → sabotage, assassination, political leverage  
- Forbidden magic → moral dilemmas, plot tension

- Plot: wars, alliances, betrayals, treasure hunts  

> Geography bukan latar belakang pasif — **membangun drama & mekanik dunia**.
> # 19. SOCIAL LAYER & CHARACTER RELATIONS

## 19.1 Overview

Karakter tidak hidup sendiri — dunia ini **bergerak melalui interaksi sosial**, bukan hanya pertarungan atau sihir.  
Semua hubungan dicatat dalam **wiki**, dengan **metrik, motivasi, dan bias NPC**.  

> Sistem ini mengadopsi:
> - Mushoku Tensei: layered social consciousness  
> - Realistic psychology: NPC salah tafsir, memori bias, trauma  
> - Narrative control: konflik dan drama muncul alami  

---

## 19.2 Core Metrics of Interaction

| Metric | Description | Scale / Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Trust** | Keyakinan bahwa seseorang bisa diandalkan | 0–100; dipengaruhi oleh aksi, reputasi, kejadian masa lalu |
| **Emotional Safety** | Tingkat aman secara psikologis | 0–100; rendah → stres, high → nyaman berbagi |
| **Dependence** | Ketergantungan emosional / fungsional | 0–100; tinggi → manipulasi, rendah → independen |
| **Distance** | Jarak interpersonal / alienation | 0–100; tinggi → jarak, rendah → dekat |
| **Awareness (Sadar)** | Apa yang karakter sadar tentang dirinya & orang lain | 0–100; dipengaruhi introspeksi, pengalaman |
| **Subconscious Influence** | Faktor tersembunyi yang memengaruhi perilaku | Simbolik, dicatat sebagai “bias / trauma / insting” |

> Semua metric bisa dicatat di **Notion / Markdown** untuk tracking perkembangan hubungan.

---

## 19.3 Layered Consciousness

### 19.3.1 Personal Consciousness
- Apa yang PC/NPC sadari tentang dirinya:
  - Ambisi
  - Ketakutan
  - Rasa bersalah
  - Tujuan
- Kesalahan umum: **karakter tidak sepenuhnya paham motifnya sendiri**  

### 19.3.2 Subconscious Layer
- Trauma masa kecil, insting rasial, bias moral  
- Pengaruh langsung tapi **tidak terlihat** pada perilaku sosial  
- Dicatat terpisah dari “kepribadian sadar”  

### 19.3.3 Social Consciousness
- Norma masyarakat, tabu, stigma  
- Bisa tunduk, melawan, atau tidak sadar sedang dikontrol  
- Contoh: Dark magic dianggap “kotor”, NPC menyembunyikan minat  

### 19.3.4 Historical Consciousness
- Bagaimana dunia & masyarakat mengingat masa lalu  
- Propaganda, legenda, sejarah resmi vs fakta  
- Trauma sejarah → kebijakan modern, konflik antar bangsa  

### 19.3.5 World/Systemic Consciousness
- Level tertinggi: dunia “mengingat” peristiwa besar  
- Dampak fisik / magis permanen: medan perang → sihir kacau, lokasi → mimpi buruk massal  

---

## 19.4 NPC Realistic Psychology

Setiap NPC punya:

1. **Motivasi pribadi** (tujuan hidup, ambisi, ketakutan)  
2. **Bias / kesalahpahaman memori** → bisa salah tafsir situasi  
3. **Interaksi natural** → bukan “statik”  
4. **Kemungkinan berubah** → hubungan bisa naik/turun secara realistis  

> Contoh:  
> NPC pedagang percaya karakter menyembunyikan artefak → paranoid → manipulasi → konflik mini  

---

## 19.5 Social Interaction Mechanics

- **Initial Meeting**: menentukan baseline trust & distance  
- **Actions & Decisions**: memengaruhi trust, emotional safety, dependence  
- **Secrets & Revelations**: menurunkan atau menaikkan metric  
- **Conflict Resolution**: duel, negosiasi, atau manipulasi  
- **Reputation Tracking**: setiap interaksi tercatat, memengaruhi plot  

> Semua metric bisa divisualisasi seperti **spreadsheet atau heatmap** untuk wiki.

---

## 19.6 Character Relationship Map (Contoh)

| Character | Trust | Emotional Safety | Dependence | Distance | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|------------|---------|-------|
| Iam → NPC A | 40 | 30 | 20 | 70 | NPC A salah paham Iam → manipulasi ringan |
| Iam → NPC B | 70 | 80 | 40 | 10 | Dekat & nyaman, loyalitas tinggi |
| NPC C → NPC D | 20 | 10 | 50 | 90 | Konflik lama, trauma sejarah memengaruhi interaksi |

> Ini **dynamic**, berubah tergantung keputusan dan peristiwa dunia.

---

## 19.7 Narrative Hooks dari Social Layer

1. **Betrayal**: trust rendah + dependence tinggi → konflik mendalam  
2. **Alliances**: trust tinggi + shared goal → plot branching  
3. **Manipulation**: NPC salah tafsir → karakter bisa memanfaatkan  
4. **Romance / Emotional Arcs**: emotional safety + awareness → pengembangan karakter realistis  
5. **Subconscious Triggering**: trauma masa lalu → perilaku ekstrem saat konflik  

---

## 19.8 Integration with Geography & Politics

- NPC dari negara berbeda → cultural norm & social consciousness berbeda  
- Trade routes, mana nodes, atau konflik historis memengaruhi trust & distance  
- Geography + politics + social layer → **mekanik plot alami & realistis**  

> Contoh: Iam di kota pelabuhan Dravok → distance tinggi dengan Elf, trust rendah dengan Dwarf merchant, emotional safety tergantung keamanan lingkungan.

# 20. MAGIC & COMBAT INTEGRATION

## 20.1 Rule-Based Magic System

Magic bukan “keren” tanpa aturan. Semua punya:

| Element | Activation | Cost | Limitation | Risk / Failure |
|---------|-----------|------|------------|----------------|
| Fire | Focus + Mana | High | Cannot sustain long | Burn caster, environmental damage |
| Ice | Ritual + Mana | Medium | Requires water source | Freeze self / allies |
| Mind | Concentration + Insight | High | Mental strain, short duration | Madness, memory loss |
| Blood | Sacrifice + Precision | Extreme | Reduces health permanently | Death, uncontrolled effect |
| Shadow | Stealth + Mana | Medium | Must be in darkness | Exposure → backlash |

> Semua spell dicatat di **wiki**, termasuk tier, effect, historical use, and known countermeasures.

---

## 20.2 Magic Mechanics

1. **Energy Definition**: Mana, Chi, Ki, or Ether (depending on culture/region)  
2. **Activation Method**: Gesture, incantation, ritual, or internal control  
3. **Cost & Risk**: Always tangible → fatigue, injury, or permanent consequence  
4. **Failure States**: Backlash, partial success, unintended side effect  
5. **Skill Growth**: Knowledge + practice, influenced by talent, focus, and emotional state  
6. **Environmental Influence**: Geography, weather, and mana nodes affect success  

> Contoh: Casting fire in high humidity → reduced effect; ice in desert → fails completely  

---

## 20.3 Combat Integration (Martial Arts Focus)

### 20.3.1 Realistic Martial Arts System

- **Base Form:** Taekwondo, Iaido, Kendo, Boxing, Wrestling (depending on character)  
- **Core Mechanics:**  
  - Strike precision → damage output  
  - Defense timing → reduces injury  
  - Stamina → accumulated over time, fatigue affects accuracy  
- **Injury Tracking:**  
  - Bruises → temporary debuff  
  - Sprain → reduces mobility  
  - Fracture → long-term debuff  
- **Cumulative Damage:** Persistent → affects future encounters  

> Combat realism: No instant heal. Trauma + skill progression critical.

---

### 20.3.2 Skill Growth

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|-------|
| Practice | Muscle memory, timing, instinct |
| Observation | Recognize patterns, anticipate attacks |
| Emotional State | Fear → slow, Rage → reckless, Calm → precision |
| Teaching / Mentorship | Accelerates learning, exposes weaknesses |

> Iam Matherys: prefers **strategic observation** → high efficiency, low risk  
> NPC Fighters: vary per experience, temperament, and training  

---

### 20.3.3 Combat Consequences

- Permanent injuries persist (limb damage, chronic pain)  
- Psychological impact → PTSD, cautious behavior  
- Tactical environment awareness → use terrain & magic synergistically  

> Contoh: Fighting on frozen river → ice manipulation + footwork critical  

---

## 20.4 Artefacts & Legendary Items

- **Definition**: Objects with inherent magic, historical significance, and limited copies  
- **Tracking**: Wiki records creation, known owners, past incidents, countermeasures  
- **Risks**: Using artefact may backfire, attract enemies, or corrupt user  
- **Integration**: Artefact usage can influence combat & social metrics  

> Contoh: “Mirror of Thorns” → amplifies attack but lowers trust with allies due to visible aggression  

---

## 20.5 Linking Social Layer & Combat

- Trust & emotional safety influence teamwork efficiency  
- NPCs with low trust → hesitant in battle, may betray  
- Emotional triggers → rage, fear → alter magic potency or martial response  
- Subconscious bias → tactical mistakes or predictable patterns  

> Contoh: Iam observes ally’s subconscious fear → adapts strategy, avoids panic triggers  

---

## 20.6 Wiki Documentation Standards

1. Each spell, skill, or artefact → entry  
2. Header format consistent: Name / Type / Cost / Limitation / Historical Use  
3. Combat mechanics → recorded per fight if significant  
4. Injuries & psychological effects → track timeline & impact  
5. NPC & PC stats → dynamic, updated after key events  

---

## 20.7 Narrative Hooks

- Magic failure → plot twist, injury, or unexpected ally interaction  
- Martial mastery → builds character reputation & trust  
- Artefact discovery → triggers quests, conflict, alliances  
- Cumulative combat effect → persistent world changes  

> Integration principle: Social + Magic + Combat = **world lives and responds**

- Language: Functional, consistent across texts → e.g., “mana exhaustion” always same term  

---

## 21.6 Geography-Driven Mechanics

1. **Climate Effects**: Frostbite, dehydration, mana flux variations  
2. **Resource Scarcity**: Impacts economy, magic, politics  
3. **Trade & Diplomacy**: Geography dictates travel, supply routes, alliances  
4. **Monster Ecology**: Native species affect survival & combat strategy  

> Example: Nivralis tundra → magical energy scarce → spells weaker → reliance on skill & artefacts

# 22. TIMELINE ABSOLUT, EVENT TRACKING & PROPAGANDA

## 22.1 Timeline Absolut

| Year (AE) | Event | Source / Reliability |
|------------|-------|--------------------|
| -5000 | Titans roam the continents, mana nodes stabilize | Myth / Partial Archaeology |
| -2000 | Zyphara elves found first magical academies | Reliable Artefacts |
| -1200 | Dwarven kingdoms collapse under internal war | Historical Records / Biased |
| 0 | Foundation of Lumeria Monarchy | Official |
| 200 | Frostpeak Warlords unite under Ironhand | Partial / Clan Oral History |
| 500 | Great Mana Crisis — global mana flux disruption | Confirmed / Records fragmentary |
| 700 | First Celestial Sightings | Mythologized in religious texts |
| 800 | Shadowfolk migration to Obscura | Oral Histories / Propaganda |
| 1200 | Sunspire Confederation gains dominance in Soltherra | Official / Biased |
| 1500 | Dragon Awakening in Zyphara | Legendary, mixed truth |
| 1800 | Shadow Uprising begins | Historical / Obscured by propaganda |
| 2000 | Modern Era begins — global trade & alliances | Verified |

> Timeline absolut = acuan untuk **semua event dunia**.  
> Tidak ada yang terjadi di vakum; semua sebab-akibat tercatat.

---

## 22.2 Event Tracking Methodology

1. **Absolute Date (AE / Year Count)**  
   - AE = Aeloria Era / global standar  
2. **Relative Date**  
   - Event sebelum / sesudah event lain  
   - Penting untuk foreshadowing & plot logic  
3. **Reliability / Source**  
   - Verified: confirmed through multiple independent sources  
   - Partial: fragmentary or uncertain sources  
   - Myth / Propaganda: story altered for political / cultural reasons  

> Contoh: “Shadowfolk migration” = oral + propaganda → NPC mungkin salah tafsir lokasi & jumlah.

---

## 22.3 Propaganda & History Manipulation

| Nation / Group | Propaganda Angle | Actual Event | Narrative Impact |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Lumeria Monarchy | Heroic founders, peaceful expansion | Used hidden assassination & espionage | Creates tension if truth revealed |
| Frostpeak Warlords | Glorious unification | Massacres & betrayal occurred | Justifies revenge arcs |
| Soltherra Nomads | Harmony with desert & sand magic | Exploited smaller tribes & monopolized water | Causes inter-tribal conflict |
| Obscura Shadow Cults | Darkness is destiny | Opportunistic, chaotic motives | Adds moral ambiguity |
| Zyphara Elves | Benevolent magic protectors | Elves hoarded knowledge, restricted outsiders | Motivates exploration / conflict |

> Propaganda penting: karakter bisa **mempercayai sejarah salah → salah keputusan → plot twist**.

---

## 22.4 Event Categories

1. **Natural Events**
   - Cataclysms: earthquakes, mana surges, floods  
   - Climate shifts: affect migration, trade, agriculture  
2. **Political Events**
   - Wars, treaties, coups, assassinations  
   - Succession crises, rebellions  
3. **Magical Events**
   - Mana fluctuations, spell disasters, magical epidemics  
   - Artefact discoveries / losses  
4. **Cultural / Social**
   - Festivals, revolutions, religious shifts  
   - Language evolution, taboo creation / dissolution  
5. **Legendary / Mythic**
   - Dragons awakening, celestial manifestations  
   - Lost civilizations, “miracle” events  

> Semua kategori terekam → bisa di-query → character & plot konsisten.

---

## 22.5 Wiki Event Entry Template

- **Name of Event**  
- **Date (Absolute / Relative)**  
- **Location / Geography**  
- **Participants / Races Involved**  
- **Outcome**  
- **Recorded Sources / Reliability**  
- **Propaganda vs Actual Event**  
- **Long-Term Consequences**  
- **NPC / Artefact Involvement**  

> Template ini memastikan **setiap event bisa di-track, disalahpahami, atau memicu konflik**.

---

## 22.6 Timeline-Driven Narrative Logic

- **Foreshadowing**  
  - NPC, artefacts, or environmental hints → muncul lebih awal di cerita  
- **Causal Chains**  
  - Event X → Event Y → Event Z → logical consistency  
- **Character Knowledge vs Truth**  
  - NPC percaya sejarah resmi → salah interpretasi → konflik alami  
- **World Memory**  
  - Dunia “mengingat” trauma → contoh: battlefield → residual magic / mana distortion  

> Goal: dunia terasa **hidup, berat, dan realistis**, bukan sekadar latar.

---

### Notes:

1. Semua event dihubungkan → membuat dunia bisa diquery untuk story, foreshadowing, atau NPC behavior.  
2. Propaganda layer → memberi peluang twist dramatis ala Mushoku Tensei / Jungle Juice.  
3. Timeline absolut → dasar logika story dan perkembangan karakter jangka panjang.

# 23. SISTEM SIHIR LENGKAP & ARTEFAK MEKANIK

## 23.1 Filosofi Sistem Sihir

- Sihir bukan sekadar “keren” → **harus rule-based**  
- Semua efek punya **definisi energi, batasan, harga, risiko, dan kegagalan**  
- Sihir memengaruhi dunia nyata → **konsekuensi permanen**  

> Contoh: “Fireball” tidak hanya membakar; bisa memicu kebakaran luas, menguras stamina, meninggalkan trauma mana.

---

## 23.2 Energi Sihir (Mana)

| Parameter | Deskripsi |
|-----------|-----------|
| Source | Mana pribadi, alam, artefak, ritual |
| Quantity | Total yang tersedia per individu → bisa bertambah dengan latihan, stagnan jika tidak digunakan |
| Flow | Cara mana dialirkan: verbal, gestural, mental, atau kombinasi |
| Resistance | Lingkungan atau ras tertentu bisa menghambat aliran mana |
| Drain / Cost | Kelelahan fisik, luka, atau efek jangka panjang |

> Pengguna liar / tanpa aturan → overload → gagal atau mati.

---

## 23.3 Activation & Rules

1. **Intent & Focus**  
   - Kesadaran karakter → menentukan sukses / gagal
2. **Formula / Gesture / Verbal Component**  
   - Tidak bisa improvisasi sembarangan (level dasar)  
3. **Environmental Modifiers**  
   - Cuaca, lokasi, keberadaan mana nodes → memengaruhi hasil  
4. **Fail States**  
   - Overcharge: ledakan area, efek samping tubuh  
   - Misfire: target salah, mundur balik ke caster  
   - Mental backlash: trauma psikologis jangka panjang  

---

## 23.4 Daftar Sihir Lengkap (Index Sample)

| Name | Tier | Effect | Cost | Failure Risk | Notes |
|------|------|--------|------|-------------|------|
| Fireball | A1 | Area burn | Medium mana + fatigue | Overheat → burns caster | Basic offensive |
| Mana Shield | B2 | Block physical & magical | High mana | Shield collapse → exposed | Defensive |
| Shadow Step | C3 | Teleport short range | Low mana | Misplacement → fall | Stealth / mobility |
| Mind Probe | B1 | Read surface thoughts | Medium mana | Mental feedback → headache | Social / tactical |
| Dragon’s Roar | S | Massive AoE damage | Extreme | Mortal blow, mana corruption | Legendary artefact skill |

> Index harus lengkap → semua sihir tercatat, termasuk tier, kegunaan, dan risiko.

---

## 23.5 Artefak & Reliquia

- **Definisi:** benda dengan kapasitas atau sifat sihir unik, dibuat / terisi oleh pengguna sebelumnya  
- **Asal-usul penting:** siapa pembuat, untuk apa, dan kenapa langka  
- **Efek samping / harga:**  
  - Bisa menguras hidup pengguna  
  - Bisa memengaruhi pikiran atau fisik  
  - Bisa menyebabkan trauma global (lokasi / medan tertentu)

| Artefak | Effect | Rarity | Known Users | Consequence / Risk |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Soulbinder Ring | Controls weak spirits | Legendary | 2 historical | Mental decay |
| Dragon Fang Staff | Amplifies fire magic | Epic | 5 recorded | Mana overflow, burns hands |
| Obsidian Tome | Forbidden rituals | Unique | 1 known | Corrupts soul, attracts shadow entities |
| Zephyr Amulet | Enhances speed | Rare | 12 recorded | Fatigue, short lifespan |

> Artefak = narasi & mekanik → bisa jadi plot driver.

---

## 23.6 Interaksi Sihir & Dunia

1. **Geografi:** medan tinggi mana → spell lebih kuat, medan negatif → spell lemah / gagal  
2. **Ras / Biologi:** dragonborn punya resistensi fire; undead mana unik  
3. **Ekonomi:** rare reagents → pasar sihir → konflik, perdagangan  
4. **Politik:** legal / banned magic → intrik, hukuman, propaganda  

---

## 23.7 Ruleset untuk Wiki

- **Entry template:**  
  - Name / Tier / Description / Activation / Cost / Failure / Historical Notes / Artefact Interaction  
- **Consistency check:**  
  - Tidak ada spell tanpa cost  
  - Efek jangka panjang selalu dicatat  
  - Artefak memiliki interaksi unik → tidak generic

---

## 23.8 Long-Term Consequences

- Penggunaan berlebihan → luka fisik & mental  
- Trauma mana → PTSD magical equivalent  
- Artefak yang disalahgunakan → destabilisasi regional / global  
- NPC & karakter bisa “belajar” dari sejarah penggunaan → plot depth

---

2. Bisa langsung di-export ke **wiki / Notion / Markdown repo**
